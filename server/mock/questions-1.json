      "body": "<p>So i'm new to JS and am working on a project to receive products based on tracking info and then with the UPC code, i get the package contents from a AJAX call to php then add the items to a array in js object format, when a UPC is scanned from a item in the package it should subtract one from the package content, the issue the function i made to subtract only works on some item objects not all and i can't seem to figure out why, there is no differences between the objects, what am i doing wrong</p>\n\n<p>heres my code</p>\n\n<pre><code>//define array\n`var packageContent = [];\n\n//create item objects\nvar Item = function(name, upc, weight, qty) {\n    this.name = name\n    this.upc = upc\n    this.weight = weight\n    this.qty = qty\n}\n\n//with php info add items with the tracking to the package content\nfunction addItemToPackage(name, upc, weight, qty) {\n    for (var i in packageContent) {\n        if (packageContent[i].upc == upc) {\n            packageContent[i].qty += qty;\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n    item = new Item(name, upc, weight, qty);\n    packageContent.push(item);\n}`\n\n//Package Content Lookup\nfunction initialInboundScan(tracking) {\n    //define tracking var\n    var tracking = tracking;\n    //AJAX request to PHP to find items assosiated with tracking #\n    $.ajax({\n    url : \"./includes/process.php\",\n    method : \"post\",\n    data : {inbound_tracking_scan:1,tracking:tracking},\n    success : function(data)\n        {\n        var items = JSON.parse(data);\n        //Loop the respone call addItemToPackage()\n        for(var i in items){\n        addItemToPackage(items[i].product_name, items[i].UPC, items[i].SKU, parseInt(items[i].qty)) \n        } \n        return packageContent;\n        }\n    });\n}\n\n// remove item from package\nfunction remove(upc) {\n    var upc = upc;\n    for (var i in packageContent) {\n        if (packageContent[i].upc == upc) {\n            packageContent[i].qty --;\n        if (packageContent[i].qty == 0) {\n        packageContent.splice(i , 1);   \n        }     \n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>the remove() function wont work on items made with the initialInboundScan(); only items made directly with the addItemToPackage() and i cant seem to figure out why the remove() function wouldn't subtract from the qty  </p>\n"
