      "title": "Some assets not loading in an old Rails 3-2-stable app",
      "body": "<p><strong>BIG UPDATES AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS POST</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have a Rails 3-2-stable app that I'm moving to a new server so I can work on upgrading it to Rails 5.  Currently, it's hosted on Heroku and most of the assets show up just fine (the app Just Works (TM)).  I have a few random assets that will not show up after precompilation on a Digital Ocean droplet.  I'm deploying with Capistrano.</p>\n\n<p>The error for the assets that won't show up look something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Loading failed for the &lt;script&gt; with source “http://stage.fancy-new-droplet.com/assets/application/application.js”.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In some cases, there will be a hash associated with the asset like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Loading failed for the &lt;script&gt; with source “http://stage.fancy-new-droplet.com/assets/application/certifications-56046476595984b00d1267a4f02822e5.js\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the former case, the asset is actually in <code>public/assets/</code> as opposed to <code>public/assets/application/</code> on the droplet.  Moving or symlinking the missing asset to that location doesn't seem to affect anything.  In the latter case, the assets just don't exist anywhere on the droplet as far as I can tell.</p>\n\n<p>For the case with no hashes in filenames, changing my include tags from this: </p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;%= javascript_include_tag \"application/application\" %&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p>To something like this:</p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;%= javascript_include_tag \"application\" %&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p>Will solve the issue but I feel like that's a red herring given the other assets that don't seem to exist after precompilation.</p>\n\n<p>I did run into an esoteric issue where the droplet was running out of memory and silently failing halfway through asset compilation but I increased the available memory and it doesn't even use half the memory now.  It does max out the CPU 100%, though.  I may try to increase both CPU and memory on the droplet.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the relevant asset compilation lines from <code>config/environments/production.rb</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  config.serve_static_assets = false\n  config.assets.compress = true\n  config.assets.compile = true\n  config.assets.digest = true\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the relevant asset compilation lines from <code>application.rb</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>config.assets.enabled = true\nconfig.assets.version = '1.0'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Locally, everything works 100% just peachy, no errors.  Assets load fine and we're all good.  Here's the asset pipeline bits from my <code>development.rb</code> file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  config.assets.compile = true\n  config.assets.compress = false\n  config.assets.debug = true\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've run various combinations of <code>rake assets:clean</code>, <code>rake assets:precompile</code>, and <code>rake assets:precompile:all</code> on the production server (in the production environment) and I've even nuked the public/assets/ folder to start it all over again.  All to no avail.</p>\n\n<p>What might cause these assets to not be created on our droplet while they do manage to get created on Heroku?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>As requested, my DO stack is simply just a droplet (2vcpu, 2gb ram), I'm using Puma and Nginx.  Here is my Capfile:</p>\n\n<pre><code># Load DSL and Setup Up Stages\nrequire 'capistrano/setup'\nrequire 'capistrano/deploy'\n\nrequire 'capistrano/scm/git'\ninstall_plugin Capistrano::SCM::Git\n\nrequire 'capistrano/rails'\nrequire 'capistrano/bundler'\nrequire 'capistrano/rvm'\nrequire 'capistrano/puma'\n\ninstall_plugin Capistrano::Puma\n\n# Loads custom tasks from `lib/capistrano/tasks' if you have any defined.\nDir.glob('lib/capistrano/tasks/*.rake').each { |r| import r }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>FURTHER EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've frobbed <code>config.assets.initialize_on_precompile</code> a couple of times in <code>application.rb</code> and ran various permutations of <code>rake assets:clean, assets:precompile</code>, and <code>assets:precompile:all</code> with <code>RAILS_ENV=production</code> locally to no avail.</p>\n\n<p><strong>YET ANOTHER EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've noticed at this point that precompiling production assets seems to not be compiling four of the javascript files, and about seven of the css files.  It also doesn't seem to put application.js into <code>public/assets/application/application.js</code> (where the app is looking), rather it lands in <code>public/assets/application.js</code>.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>MORE EDITS</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have resolved the issue of the JavaScript assets not loading by fixing a <code>require_tree</code> statement in <code>application.js</code> and now the only issue seems to be several missing CSS files.</p>\n\n<p>In this application there are two directories with css files:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>app/assets/stylesheets/</code></li>\n<li><code>app/assets/stylesheets/application</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are a total of 21 stylesheets that do not load out of nearly 100 total.  The stylesheets that don't load are being called with a hashed filename (<code>somefile-hash.css</code>) but those hashed files don't exist in <code>public/assets/</code> on the droplet. </p>\n\n<p>Here's the requires from <code>application.css.scss</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/*\n *= require_self\n *= require chosen\n *= require jquery-ui/autocomplete\n *= require jquery-ui/datepicker\n *= require feature-carousel\n *= require_tree .\n */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Out of frustration, I added <code>= require_directory ./assets</code> to that list and now I've only got about 15 stylesheets failing to compile/load.  That behaviour doesn't make any sense to me as I assumed the <code>= require_tree .</code> would've covered the wonky subdirectory.</p>\n\n<p>Individually specifying files <code>= require foo</code> or <code>= require foo.css.scss</code> does not seem to affect anything, either.</p>\n\n<p>I also bumped the <code>config.assets.version</code> out of frustration to no avail.</p>\n\n<p>And furthermore, no amount of foul language can persuade these assets to compile.</p>\n"

      "body": "<p>I'm a Redux beginner and after watching a few tutorials i still have a few questions:</p>\n\n<p>1) \nAfter creating my <code>store</code>, i have:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ReactDOM.render(&lt;Provider store={store}&gt;&lt;BrowserRouter&gt;&lt;App/&gt;&lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;&lt;/Provider&gt;, document.getElementById('root'));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Going into the <code>App</code> component, i define:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function mapStateToProps(state) {\n    return {\n        posts: state.posts,\n        comments: state.comments \n\n    }\n}\n\nfunction mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {\n    return bindActionCreators(actions, dispatch)\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where do <code>state</code> and <code>dispatch</code> come from? Is this automatically referring to the <code>store</code>'s state and dispatch since i connected it to my component?</p>\n\n<p>2) One of my React components has a form which on submit, calls a function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>handleSubmit(event) { ... }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So in the constructor of that component, i have:</p>\n\n<pre><code>constructor() {\n    super()\n    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is calling <code>super()</code> always necessary when declaring a React class component?\nWhy do i need to do this type of binding there? </p>\n\n<p>3) After submitting that form, i dispatch an action called <code>addPost</code>.\nHow does it \"go\" to the reducer? Is it just because the reducer was given when i created the store and using <code>mapDispatchToProps(dispatch)</code> i \"let\" Redux know which actions could be dispatched to that reducer?</p>\n\n<p>4) The reducer simply returns a <code>state</code> object - where is the logic that actually \"saves\" that state into the store? Is it hidden?</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the long post and thank you!</p>\n"
