      "title": "std::vector on VisualStudio2008 appears to be suboptimally implemented - too many copy constructor calls",
      "body": "<p>I've been comparing a STL implementation of a popular XmlRpc library with an implementation that mostly avoids STL.  The STL implementation is much slower - I got 47s down to 4.5s.  I've diagnosed some of the reasons: it's partly due to std::string being mis-used (e.g. the author should have used \"const std::string&amp;\" wherever possible - don't just use std::string's as if they were Java strings), but it's also because copy constructors were being constantly called each time the vector outgrew its bounds, which was exceedingly often. The copy constructors were very slow because they did deep-copies of trees (of XmlRpc values).</p>\n\n<p>I was told by someone else on StackOverflow that std::vector implementations typically double the size of the buffer each time they outgrow.  This does not seem to be the case on VisualStudio 2008:  to add 50 items to a std::vector took 177 calls of the copy constructor.  Doubling each time should call the copy constructor 64 times.  If you were very concerned about keeping memory usage low, then increasing by 50% each time should call the copy constructor 121 times.  So where does the 177 come from?</p>\n\n<p>My question is: (a) why is the copy constructor called so often?  (b) is there any way to avoid using the copy constructor if you're just <em>moving</em> an object from one location to another?  (In this case and indeed most cases a memcpy() would have sufficed - and this makes a BIG difference).</p>\n\n<p>(NB: I know about vector::reserve(), I'm just a bit disappointed that application programmers would need to implement the doubling trick when something like this is already part of any good STL implementation.)</p>\n\n<p>My test program:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;string&gt;\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n#include &lt;vector&gt;\n\n\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n\nint constructorCalls;\nint assignmentCalls;\nint copyCalls;\n\n\nclass C {\n    int n;\n\npublic:\n    C(int _n) { n = _n; constructorCalls++; }\n    C(const C&amp; orig) { copyCalls++; n = orig.n; }\n    void operator=(const C &amp;orig) { assignmentCalls++; n = orig.n; }\n};\n\n\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[])\n{\n    std::vector&lt;C&gt; A;\n\n    //A.reserve(50);\n    for (int i=0; i &lt; 50; i++)\n        A.push_back(i);\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"constructor calls = \" &lt;&lt; constructorCalls &lt;&lt; \"\\n\";\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"assignment calls = \" &lt;&lt; assignmentCalls &lt;&lt; \"\\n\";\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"copy calls = \" &lt;&lt; copyCalls &lt;&lt; \"\\n\";\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n"

      "body": "<p>We've just bought a 32-core Opteron machine, and the speedups we get are a little disappointing:  beyond about 24 threads we see no speedup at all (actually gets slower overall) and after about 6 threads it becomes significantly sub-linear.</p>\n\n<p>Our application is very thread-friendly:  our job breaks down into about 170,000 little tasks which can each be executed separately, each taking 5-10 seconds.  They all read from the same memory-mapped file of size about 4Gb. They make occasional writes to it, but it might be 10,000 reads to each write - we just write a little bit of data at the end of each of the 170,000 tasks. The writes are lock-protected.  Profiling shows that the locks are not a problem. The threads use a lot of JVM memory each in non-shared objects and they make very little access to shared JVM objects and of that, only a small percentage of accesses involve writes.</p>\n\n<p>We're programming in Java, on Linux, with NUMA enabled. We have 128Gb RAM. We have 2 Opteron CPU's (model 6274) of 16 cores each. Each CPU has 2 NUMA nodes. The same job running on an Intel quad-core (i.e. 8 cores) scaled nearly linearly up to 8 threads.</p>\n\n<p>We've tried replicating the read-only data to have one-per-thread, in the hope that most lookups can be local to a NUMA node, but we observed no speedup from this.</p>\n\n<p>With 32 threads, 'top' shows the CPU's 74% \"us\" (user) and about 23% \"id\" (idle). But there are no sleeps and almost no disk i/o.  With 24 threads we get 83% CPU usage.  I'm not sure how to interpret 'idle' state - does this mean 'waiting for memory controller'?  </p>\n\n<p>We tried turning NUMA on and off (I'm referring to the Linux-level setting that requires a reboot) and saw no difference. When NUMA was enabled, 'numastat' showed only about 5% of 'allocation and access misses' (95% of cache misses were local to the NUMA node).  [Edit:] But adding \"-XX:+useNUMA\" as a java commandline flag gave us a 10% boost.</p>\n\n<p>One theory we have is that we're maxing out the memory controllers, because our application uses a lot of RAM and we think there are a lot of cache misses.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What can we do to either (a) speed up our program to approach linear scalability, or (b) diagnose what's happening?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Also: (c) how do I interpret the 'top' result - does 'idle' mean 'blocked on memory controllers'?  and (d) is there any difference in the characteristics of Opteron vs Xeon's?</p>\n"

Where the dialog box background is also grey, this is not a problem, but inside a tab control, where the background is white, the grey background to the text is very noticeable.</p>\n\n<p>In the past we have done a lot of our own drawing of controls, but these days we are trying to use the standard look'n'feel as much as possible, and to avoid overriding standard behaviour as much as possible.  </p>\n\n<p>We are using the Win32 API, which is getting a bit dated, but I think the problem occurs even with ATL.   We are creating a DIALOGTEMPLATE. The text is in a \"static\" control (0x0082).  The only flag we set for the style is \"SS_LEFT\".  The text control is inside a tab control:  \"SysTabControl32\" with only one flag:  WS_CLIPSIBLINGS set on it.

Is the \"idle\" state what you see when a CPU is waiting for a non-local access?  If not, then what is the explanation?</p>\n"

However, I get \"StackOverflowException\", despite significantly increasing the JVM stack size.  I did some googling, and apparently this is a well known limitation of java serialisation:  that it doesn't work for deeply nested object graphs such as long linked lists - it uses a stack record for each link in the chain, and it doesn't do anything clever such as a breadth-first traversal, and therefore you very quickly get a stack overflow.</p>\n\n<p>The recommended solution is to customise the serialisation code by overriding readObject() and writeObject(), however this seems a little complex to me.</p>\n\n<p>(It may or may not be relevant, but I'm storing a bunch of fields on each edge in the graph so I have a class <code>JuNode</code> which contains a member <code>ArrayList&lt;JuEdge&gt; links;</code>, i.e. there are 2 classes involved, rather than plain object references from one node to another.  It shouldn't matter for the purposes of the question).</p>\n\n<p>My question is threefold:<br>\n(a) why don't the implementors of Java rectify this limitation or are they already working on it?  (I can't believe I'm the first person to ever want to serialise a graph in java)<br>\n(b) is there a better way?  Is there some drop-in alternative to the default serialisation classes that does it in a cleverer way?<br>\n(c) if my best option is to get my hands dirty with low-level code, does someone have an example of graph serialisation java source-code that can use to learn how to do it?  </p>\n"
