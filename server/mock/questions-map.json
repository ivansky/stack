    "body": "<p>I've been comparing a STL implementation of a popular XmlRpc library with an implementation that mostly avoids STL.  The STL implementation is much slower - I got 47s down to 4.5s.  I've diagnosed some of the reasons: it's partly due to std::string being mis-used (e.g. the author should have used \"const std::string&amp;\" wherever possible - don't just use std::string's as if they were Java strings), but it's also because copy constructors were being constantly called each time the vector outgrew its bounds, which was exceedingly often. The copy constructors were very slow because they did deep-copies of trees (of XmlRpc values).</p>\n\n<p>I was told by someone else on StackOverflow that std::vector implementations typically double the size of the buffer each time they outgrow.  This does not seem to be the case on VisualStudio 2008:  to add 50 items to a std::vector took 177 calls of the copy constructor.  Doubling each time should call the copy constructor 64 times.  If you were very concerned about keeping memory usage low, then increasing by 50% each time should call the copy constructor 121 times.  So where does the 177 come from?</p>\n\n<p>My question is: (a) why is the copy constructor called so often?  (b) is there any way to avoid using the copy constructor if you're just <em>moving</em> an object from one location to another?  (In this case and indeed most cases a memcpy() would have sufficed - and this makes a BIG difference).</p>\n\n<p>(NB: I know about vector::reserve(), I'm just a bit disappointed that application programmers would need to implement the doubling trick when something like this is already part of any good STL implementation.)</p>\n\n<p>My test program:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;string&gt;\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n#include &lt;vector&gt;\n\n\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n\nint constructorCalls;\nint assignmentCalls;\nint copyCalls;\n\n\nclass C {\n    int n;\n\npublic:\n    C(int _n) { n = _n; constructorCalls++; }\n    C(const C&amp; orig) { copyCalls++; n = orig.n; }\n    void operator=(const C &amp;orig) { assignmentCalls++; n = orig.n; }\n};\n\n\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[])\n{\n    std::vector&lt;C&gt; A;\n\n    //A.reserve(50);\n    for (int i=0; i &lt; 50; i++)\n        A.push_back(i);\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"constructor calls = \" &lt;&lt; constructorCalls &lt;&lt; \"\\n\";\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"assignment calls = \" &lt;&lt; assignmentCalls &lt;&lt; \"\\n\";\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"copy calls = \" &lt;&lt; copyCalls &lt;&lt; \"\\n\";\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n"

Firstly, it's horrible \"obese\", consider:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;struct&gt;\n    &lt;member&gt;\n        &lt;name&gt;ROOM_ID&lt;/name&gt;\n        &lt;value&gt;\n            &lt;int&gt;1&lt;/int&gt;\n        &lt;/value&gt;\n    &lt;/member&gt;\n\n    &lt;member&gt;\n        &lt;name&gt;CODE&lt;/name&gt;\n        &lt;value&gt;\n            &lt;string&gt;MR-101&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;/value&gt;\n    &lt;/member&gt;\n\n    &lt;member&gt;\n        &lt;name&gt;NAME&lt;/name&gt;\n        &lt;value&gt;\n            &lt;string&gt;Math Room&lt;/string&gt;\n        &lt;/value&gt;\n    &lt;/member&gt;\n\n    &lt;member&gt;\n        &lt;name&gt;CAPACITY&lt;/name&gt;\n        &lt;value&gt;\n            &lt;int&gt;30&lt;/int&gt;\n        &lt;/value&gt;\n    &lt;/member&gt;\n&lt;/struct&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Compared to this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;room&gt;&lt;ROOM_ID&gt;1&lt;/ROOM_ID&gt;&lt;CODE&gt;MR-101&lt;/CODE&gt;\n&lt;NAME&gt;Math Room&lt;/NAME&gt;&lt;CAPACITY&gt;30&lt;/CAPACITY&gt;&lt;/room&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or even this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;room ROOM_ID=1 CODE=MR-101 NAME=”Math Room” CAPACITY=30 /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Secondly, XML-RPC seems fairly widespread but not quite ubiquitous and I'm not that impressed with the support for it in C++ and PHP. I've had problems with all the libraries that I tried in both languages.</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, it seems to me that I could make remote procedure calls with plain XML as easily as  with XML-RPC.  {(9/9/2009): Every language has libraries for serialising language-level objects into XML. Both XML and XML-RPC require application-level schemas to be defined, for example, how the fields should be spelt, but neither needs any additional schema to be defined. Many people make RPC calls with plain XML.}</p>\n\n<p>So what is the value-add of XML-RPC?</p>\n"

    "title": "How do I serialise a graph in Java without getting StackOverflowException?",
    "body": "<p>I have a graph structure in java, (\"graph\" as in \"edges and nodes\") and I'm attempting to serialise it.  However, I get \"StackOverflowException\", despite significantly increasing the JVM stack size.  I did some googling, and apparently this is a well known limitation of java serialisation:  that it doesn't work for deeply nested object graphs such as long linked lists - it uses a stack record for each link in the chain, and it doesn't do anything clever such as a breadth-first traversal, and therefore you very quickly get a stack overflow.</p>\n\n<p>The recommended solution is to customise the serialisation code by overriding readObject() and writeObject(), however this seems a little complex to me.</p>\n\n<p>(It may or may not be relevant, but I'm storing a bunch of fields on each edge in the graph so I have a class <code>JuNode</code> which contains a member <code>ArrayList&lt;JuEdge&gt; links;</code>, i.e. there are 2 classes involved, rather than plain object references from one node to another.  It shouldn't matter for the purposes of the question).</p>\n\n<p>My question is threefold:<br>\n(a) why don't the implementors of Java rectify this limitation or are they already working on it?  (I can't believe I'm the first person to ever want to serialise a graph in java)<br>\n(b) is there a better way?  Is there some drop-in alternative to the default serialisation classes that does it in a cleverer way?<br>\n(c) if my best option is to get my hands dirty with low-level code, does someone have an example of graph serialisation java source-code that can use to learn how to do it?  </p>\n"

    "title": "many-core CPU&#39;s: Programming techniques to avoid disappointing scalability",
    "body": "<p>We've just bought a 32-core Opteron machine, and the speedups we get are a little disappointing:  beyond about 24 threads we see no speedup at all (actually gets slower overall) and after about 6 threads it becomes significantly sub-linear.</p>\n\n<p>Our application is very thread-friendly:  our job breaks down into about 170,000 little tasks which can each be executed separately, each taking 5-10 seconds.  They all read from the same memory-mapped file of size about 4Gb. They make occasional writes to it, but it might be 10,000 reads to each write - we just write a little bit of data at the end of each of the 170,000 tasks. The writes are lock-protected.  Profiling shows that the locks are not a problem. The threads use a lot of JVM memory each in non-shared objects and they make very little access to shared JVM objects and of that, only a small percentage of accesses involve writes.</p>\n\n<p>We're programming in Java, on Linux, with NUMA enabled. We have 128Gb RAM. We have 2 Opteron CPU's (model 6274) of 16 cores each. Each CPU has 2 NUMA nodes. The same job running on an Intel quad-core (i.e. 8 cores) scaled nearly linearly up to 8 threads.</p>\n\n<p>We've tried replicating the read-only data to have one-per-thread, in the hope that most lookups can be local to a NUMA node, but we observed no speedup from this.</p>\n\n<p>With 32 threads, 'top' shows the CPU's 74% \"us\" (user) and about 23% \"id\" (idle). But there are no sleeps and almost no disk i/o.  With 24 threads we get 83% CPU usage.  I'm not sure how to interpret 'idle' state - does this mean 'waiting for memory controller'?  </p>\n\n<p>We tried turning NUMA on and off (I'm referring to the Linux-level setting that requires a reboot) and saw no difference. When NUMA was enabled, 'numastat' showed only about 5% of 'allocation and access misses' (95% of cache misses were local to the NUMA node).  [Edit:] But adding \"-XX:+useNUMA\" as a java commandline flag gave us a 10% boost.</p>\n\n<p>One theory we have is that we're maxing out the memory controllers, because our application uses a lot of RAM and we think there are a lot of cache misses.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What can we do to either (a) speed up our program to approach linear scalability, or (b) diagnose what's happening?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Also: (c) how do I interpret the 'top' result - does 'idle' mean 'blocked on memory controllers'?  and (d) is there any difference in the characteristics of Opteron vs Xeon's?</p>\n"

    "title": "Weird Tomcat outage, possibly related to maxConnections",
    "body": "<p>In my company we experienced a serious problem today: our production server went down.  Most people accessing our software via a browser were unable to get a connection, however people who had already been using the software were able to continue using it. Even our hot standby server was unable to communicate with the production server, which it does using HTTP, not even going out to the broader internet. The whole time the server was accessible via ping and ssh, and in fact was quite underloaded - it's normally running at 5% CPU load and it was even lower at this time. We do almost no disk i/o.</p>\n\n<p>A few days after the problem started we have a new variation:  port 443 (HTTPS) is responding but port 80 stopped responding. The server load is very low. Immediately after restarting tomcat, port 80 started responding again.</p>\n\n<p>We're using tomcat7, with maxThreads=\"200\", and using maxConnections=10000. We serve all data out of main memory, so each HTTP request completes very quickly, but we have a large number of users doing very simple interactions (this is high school subject selection). But it seems very unlikely we would have 10,000 users all with their browser open on our page at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>My question has several parts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is it likely that the \"maxConnections\" parameter is the cause of our woes?</li>\n<li>Is there any reason not to set \"maxConnections\" to a ridiculously high value e.g. 100,000?  (i.e. what's the cost of doing so?)</li>\n<li>Does tomcat output a warning message anywhere once it hits the \"maxConnections\" message?  (We didn't notice anything).</li>\n<li>Is it possible there's an OS limit we're hitting?  We're using CentOS 6.4 (Linux) and \"ulimit -f\" says \"unlimited\".  (Do firewalls understand the concept of Tcp/Ip connections? Could there be a limit elsewhere?)</li>\n<li>What happens when tomcat hits the \"maxConnections\" limit? Does it try to close down some inactive connections?  If not, why not?  I don't like the idea that our server can be held to ransom by people having their browsers on it, sending the keep-alive's to keep the connection open.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But the main question is, \"How do we fix our server?\"</p>\n\n<p>More info as requested by Stefan and Sharpy:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Our clients communicate directly with this server</li>\n<li>TCP connections were in some cases immediately refused and in other cases timed out</li>\n<li>The problem is evident even connecting my browser to the server within the network, or with the hot standby server - also in the same network - unable to do database replication messages which normally happens over HTTP</li>\n<li>IPTables - yes, IPTables6 - I don't think so. Anyway, there's nothing between my browser and the server when I test after noticing the problem.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>More info:\nIt really looked like we had solved the problem when we realised we were using the default Tomcat7 setting of BIO, which has one thread per connection, and we had maxThreads=200. In fact 'netstat -an' showed about 297 connections, which matches 200 + queue of 100. So we changed this to NIO and restarted tomcat. Unfortunately the same problem occurred the following day.  It's possible we misconfigured the server.xml.</p>\n\n<p>The server.xml and extract from catalina.out is available here:\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sxgd0fbzyvuldy7/AACZWoBKXNKfXjsSmkgkVgW_a?dl=0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sxgd0fbzyvuldy7/AACZWoBKXNKfXjsSmkgkVgW_a?dl=0</a></p>\n\n<p>More info:\nI did a load test.  I'm able to create 500 connections from my development laptop, and do an HTTP GET 3 times on each, without any problem. Unless my load test is invalid (the Java class is also in the above link).</p>\n"

    "body": "<p>I'm a developer of Windows desktop software, and from time to time our app crashes.  In rare cases I'd like to get a customer to run a debug version of the app to send me a stack trace so I know where it crashed.  I followed the instructions in here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6205981/windows-c-stack-trace-from-a-running-app/28276227\">Windows C++ stack trace from a running app</a></p>\n\n<p>...but while it works on my development machine, it doesn't work on any client machine or those of my colleagues, who don't have Visual Studio installed.  So I presume that there's some .dll or something they need before it'll work. They're using the same .exe I'm using, i.e. the one I compiled in VC++ in debug mode.</p>\n\n<p>After some painstaking \"message window\" debugging, I learnt it's failing in SymGetSymFromAddr64() - this returns FALSE. But when I walk the stack, this always returns FALSE or it returns garbage that doesn't make sense (random unrelated method names), as if it's the PC values which are invalid, not the mapping process.  To reiterate, it's a debug mode .exe that produces a perfect symbolic stack trace on my development machine. </p>\n\n<p>I did some research and found some mentions of \"dbghelp.dll\" and \"imagehlp.dll\" but I just ended up confused.  \"dbghelp.dll\" ships with all versions of Windows, but with reduced functionality. There's some other things I could install, but it's a little scary to be installing some Windows \"WDK\" or \"debug kits\" which might overwrite important system .dll's or do god-knows-what to your computer.</p>\n\n<p>So what I need to know is:  \"what's the simplest set of instructions I can give to these helper customers e.g. the minimum set of .dll's and where to stick them so that we can get proper symbolic information out of the stack traces when our program crashes?\"</p>\n"

    "body": "<p>I'm failing to get the Bing Maps API working.  I'm inputting a query \"How do I get from Annandale to Eastwood (Sydney) using public transport?\" and getting results that have completely different times to what I queried.</p>\n\n<p>The API is documented here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff701717.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff701717.aspx</a></p>\n\n<p>and here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff701718.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff701718.aspx</a></p>\n\n<p>The documentation fails to specify what date format the responses are in, but I presume this is correct:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/bleroy/dates-and-json\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://weblogs.asp.net/bleroy/dates-and-json</a></p>\n\n<p>So here's my query:\n<a href=\"http://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/V1/Routes/Transit?wp.0=-33.886620,151.171720&amp;wp.1=-33.785780,151.075740&amp;timeType=Departure&amp;dateTime=11:43:00&amp;maxSolns=3&amp;output=json&amp;key=(redacted)\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/V1/Routes/Transit?wp.0=-33.886620,151.171720&amp;wp.1=-33.785780,151.075740&amp;timeType=Departure&amp;dateTime=11:43:00&amp;maxSolns=3&amp;output=json&amp;key=(redacted)</a></p>\n\n<p>Note that I redacted our API key, for obvious reasons.  </p>\n\n<p>Note that I'm requesting a bus at 11:43am.  I've tried this in conjunction with a date and without a date, it makes no difference.</p>\n\n<p>I get a response which looks quite valid at first glance, but it's giving me times like this:\n\"time\":\"/Date(1427222880000-0700)/\"</p>\n\n<p>...which would be reasonable if my query time was 5:43, but it's not. That date format clearly indicates \"milliseconds since 1970, UTC\" (in desperation I tried adding &amp; subtracting 7 hrs, but got nothing meaningful). The documentation clearly says my time of 11:43 should be specified in the local timezone, i.e. just as \"11:43\".  </p>\n\n<p>Proceeding on the assumption that the Bing documentation is wrong or that the implementation is wrong, I tried arbitrarily adding 6 hrs or subtracting 18 hrs from my query time (that necessitated adding the date into the URL), but I got nothing that made sense.  I can't get any correspondence between my API results and the public Bing browser app.</p>\n\n<p>I couldn't find out who to ask from Microsoft either.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n"

    "body": "<p>I'm writing an Android app and I need to take photos.  I got it mostly working very quickly using the standard tutorial.  But I need to write a blocking version of \"takePicture()\".  I've trying reworking my design so that everything is done asynchronously, but the code just ends up as spaghetti code because so many tasks are dependent on the previous task completing.  And I had expected that taking a photo would take less than a second.  So I think it's a reasonable goal to have a blocking (synchronous) \"takePicture()\".</p>\n\n<p>So I created a camera in the UI thread (I'm an Android newbie but I presume that 'onCreate()' et al are called in the UI thread).  I also open the camera and release it in the UI thread.  I also call \"takePicture()\" in the UI thread.  I tried polling for a \"volatile byte[] jpeg;\" field to become non-null, with a \"while (jpeg != null) sleep(1000);\" but it never gets assigned.  To my surprise, my callback doesn't get called until I pass out of the \"onClick()\" function - 'takePicture()' doesn't seem to trigger anything, it merely queues something, as far as I can figure out.</p>\n\n<p>My next attempt involved doing all the camera work (open, takePicture, release) in a \"ExecutorService.newSingleThreadExecutor()\" but that was also unsuccessful.  Even when I did it this way (see below), the callback wasn't called until the app finished the 'onClick()'.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public byte[] takePhoto()\n{\n    if (camera == null)\n        return null;\n    cameraThreadService.submit(new Runnable() {\n        @Override\n        public void run() {\n            Camera.PictureCallback mPicture = new Camera.PictureCallback() {\n\n                @Override\n                public void onPictureTaken(byte[] data, Camera camera) {\n                    jpeg = data;\n                }\n            };\n            camera.takePicture(null, null, mPicture);\n        }\n    });\n    int n = 0;\n    while (jpeg == null) {\n        sleep(1000);\n        if (n++ &gt; 5)\n            break;\n    }\n    return jpeg;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Can anyone tell me how to write a blocking (synchronous) 'camera.takePicture()'?</p>\n"

    "body": "<p>I'm writing an Android app which pulls photos from the gallery.  I discovered that some photos, e.g. a panorama taken in a left direction by a Galaxy S7, are output by the built-in camera app as a \"non-normalised jpeg\" file, meaning that the image is upside down (or even vertical for a landscape panorama on a Galaxy S5), but it contains instructions in the EXIF data that the viewer should fix it up.</p>\n\n<p>So I read up on ExifInterface and I implemented code to normalise the images:</p>\n\n<pre><code>                ExifInterface exif = new ExifInterface(file.toString());\n                int orig = exif.getAttributeInt(ExifInterface.TAG_ORIENTATION, -1);\n                if (orig != -1 &amp;&amp; orig != ExifInterface.ORIENTATION_NORMAL) {\n                    orientation = orig;\n                    exif.setAttribute(ExifInterface.TAG_ORIENTATION, String.valueOf(ExifInterface.ORIENTATION_NORMAL));\n                    exif.saveAttributes();\n                }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<pre><code>        Matrix matrix = null;\n        if (orientation != ExifInterface.ORIENTATION_NORMAL) {\n            matrix = new Matrix();\n            switch (orientation) {\n                case ExifInterface.ORIENTATION_ROTATE_90:   matrix.postRotate(90); break;\n                case ExifInterface.ORIENTATION_ROTATE_180:  matrix.postRotate(180); break;\n                case ExifInterface.ORIENTATION_ROTATE_270:  matrix.postRotate(-90); break;\n            }\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...\netc</p>\n\n<p>However, on a Galaxy S7, my code fails to work.  After some debugging and delving into system source-code, I discovered that the ExifInterface object stores multiple conflicting values for the \"Orientation\" attribute, and it was returning the wrong one.  The correct value (i.e. 3) is stored in exif.mAttributes[4] (does this correspond to IFD_THUMBNAIL_TAGS group?) and the incorrect value (i.e. 1) is stored in exif.mAttributes[0] (does this correspond to IFD_TIFF_TAGS?).  So 'exif' reported that it's ORIENTATION_NORMAL but the image loads upside-down, and my matrix code is not called.</p>\n\n<p>What is the recommended solution, or any solution to this problem?</p>\n"

    "title": "Some assets not loading in an old Rails 3-2-stable app",
    "body": "<p><strong>BIG UPDATES AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS POST</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have a Rails 3-2-stable app that I'm moving to a new server so I can work on upgrading it to Rails 5.  Currently, it's hosted on Heroku and most of the assets show up just fine (the app Just Works (TM)).  I have a few random assets that will not show up after precompilation on a Digital Ocean droplet.  I'm deploying with Capistrano.</p>\n\n<p>The error for the assets that won't show up look something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Loading failed for the &lt;script&gt; with source “http://stage.fancy-new-droplet.com/assets/application/application.js”.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In some cases, there will be a hash associated with the asset like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Loading failed for the &lt;script&gt; with source “http://stage.fancy-new-droplet.com/assets/application/certifications-56046476595984b00d1267a4f02822e5.js\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the former case, the asset is actually in <code>public/assets/</code> as opposed to <code>public/assets/application/</code> on the droplet.  Moving or symlinking the missing asset to that location doesn't seem to affect anything.  In the latter case, the assets just don't exist anywhere on the droplet as far as I can tell.</p>\n\n<p>For the case with no hashes in filenames, changing my include tags from this: </p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;%= javascript_include_tag \"application/application\" %&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p>To something like this:</p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;%= javascript_include_tag \"application\" %&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p>Will solve the issue but I feel like that's a red herring given the other assets that don't seem to exist after precompilation.</p>\n\n<p>I did run into an esoteric issue where the droplet was running out of memory and silently failing halfway through asset compilation but I increased the available memory and it doesn't even use half the memory now.  It does max out the CPU 100%, though.  I may try to increase both CPU and memory on the droplet.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the relevant asset compilation lines from <code>config/environments/production.rb</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  config.serve_static_assets = false\n  config.assets.compress = true\n  config.assets.compile = true\n  config.assets.digest = true\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the relevant asset compilation lines from <code>application.rb</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>config.assets.enabled = true\nconfig.assets.version = '1.0'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Locally, everything works 100% just peachy, no errors.  Assets load fine and we're all good.  Here's the asset pipeline bits from my <code>development.rb</code> file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  config.assets.compile = true\n  config.assets.compress = false\n  config.assets.debug = true\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've run various combinations of <code>rake assets:clean</code>, <code>rake assets:precompile</code>, and <code>rake assets:precompile:all</code> on the production server (in the production environment) and I've even nuked the public/assets/ folder to start it all over again.  All to no avail.</p>\n\n<p>What might cause these assets to not be created on our droplet while they do manage to get created on Heroku?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>As requested, my DO stack is simply just a droplet (2vcpu, 2gb ram), I'm using Puma and Nginx.  Here is my Capfile:</p>\n\n<pre><code># Load DSL and Setup Up Stages\nrequire 'capistrano/setup'\nrequire 'capistrano/deploy'\n\nrequire 'capistrano/scm/git'\ninstall_plugin Capistrano::SCM::Git\n\nrequire 'capistrano/rails'\nrequire 'capistrano/bundler'\nrequire 'capistrano/rvm'\nrequire 'capistrano/puma'\n\ninstall_plugin Capistrano::Puma\n\n# Loads custom tasks from `lib/capistrano/tasks' if you have any defined.\nDir.glob('lib/capistrano/tasks/*.rake').each { |r| import r }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>FURTHER EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've frobbed <code>config.assets.initialize_on_precompile</code> a couple of times in <code>application.rb</code> and ran various permutations of <code>rake assets:clean, assets:precompile</code>, and <code>assets:precompile:all</code> with <code>RAILS_ENV=production</code> locally to no avail.</p>\n\n<p><strong>YET ANOTHER EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've noticed at this point that precompiling production assets seems to not be compiling four of the javascript files, and about seven of the css files.  It also doesn't seem to put application.js into <code>public/assets/application/application.js</code> (where the app is looking), rather it lands in <code>public/assets/application.js</code>.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>MORE EDITS</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have resolved the issue of the JavaScript assets not loading by fixing a <code>require_tree</code> statement in <code>application.js</code> and now the only issue seems to be several missing CSS files.</p>\n\n<p>In this application there are two directories with css files:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>app/assets/stylesheets/</code></li>\n<li><code>app/assets/stylesheets/application</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are a total of 21 stylesheets that do not load out of nearly 100 total.  The stylesheets that don't load are being called with a hashed filename (<code>somefile-hash.css</code>) but those hashed files don't exist in <code>public/assets/</code> on the droplet. </p>\n\n<p>Here's the requires from <code>application.css.scss</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/*\n *= require_self\n *= require chosen\n *= require jquery-ui/autocomplete\n *= require jquery-ui/datepicker\n *= require feature-carousel\n *= require_tree .\n */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Out of frustration, I added <code>= require_directory ./assets</code> to that list and now I've only got about 15 stylesheets failing to compile/load.  That behaviour doesn't make any sense to me as I assumed the <code>= require_tree .</code> would've covered the wonky subdirectory.</p>\n\n<p>Individually specifying files <code>= require foo</code> or <code>= require foo.css.scss</code> does not seem to affect anything, either.</p>\n\n<p>I also bumped the <code>config.assets.version</code> out of frustration to no avail.</p>\n\n<p>And furthermore, no amount of foul language can persuade these assets to compile.</p>\n"

Is this automatically referring to the <code>store</code>'s state and dispatch since i connected it to my component?</p>\n\n<p>2) One of my React components has a form which on submit, calls a function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>handleSubmit(event) { ... }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So in the constructor of that component, i have:</p>\n\n<pre><code>constructor() {\n    super()\n    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is calling <code>super()</code> always necessary when declaring a React class component?\nWhy do i need to do this type of binding there? </p>\n\n<p>3) After submitting that form, i dispatch an action called <code>addPost</code>.\nHow does it \"go\" to the reducer? Is it just because the reducer was given when i created the store and using <code>mapDispatchToProps(dispatch)</code> i \"let\" Redux know which actions could be dispatched to that reducer?</p>\n\n<p>4) The reducer simply returns a <code>state</code> object - where is the logic that actually \"saves\" that state into the store? Is it hidden?</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the long post and thank you!</p>\n"

As far as I can tell, <code>ungroup</code> ignores any arguments provided and always ungroups everything.</p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mtcars %&gt;%\n  group_by(cyl, vs, am) %&gt;%\n  # this removes 'am' but grouping by 'cyl' and 'vs' remain\n  summarize(n = n()) %&gt;%  \n  ungroup(vs)  # I want this to work but it ungroups everything, not just 'vs'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is there a way to remove the grouping by <code>vs</code> while keeping the grouping by <code>cyl</code>?

I just tried this and it works with no fuss due to <code>add=FALSE</code> in <code>group_by</code>, and it's as clean as what I was hoping <code>ungroup</code> could do:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mtcars %&gt;%\n  group_by(cyl, vs, am) %&gt;%\n  summarize(n = n()) %&gt;%  \n  group_by(cyl)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thanks to @camille and @julius-vainora I know that <code>ungroup</code> by itself cannot do this, so I'll have to do grouping rather than ungrouping. @RyanD's suggestions were also very helpful. </p>\n"

If it times out, I throw an exception back to client as well as create another <code>scheduledfuture</code> to cancel first <code>future</code> eventually after a while. The idea is to give sometime after initial timeout for <code>future</code> to complete its task, but if it doesn't complete in that time, just kill it.</p>\n\n<p>My code looks like</p>\n\n<pre><code>try {\n    return future.get(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\n} catch (TimeoutException) {\n   //create a scheduledfuture here which waits for another 5s\n   // and kill the above future is it is still not done\n   //the callable of scheduledfuture looks like -\n   /*\n   if (!future.isDone()) {\n       future.cancel(true);\n   }\n   */\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now two questions here -<br>\n1. The <code>future.cancel(true)</code> will just set the interrupt flag to true. It will not end the task as it is. How should I end the task? Is there a JVM process internally that checks threads for interrupted flag and terminates them if true?<br>\n2. As the interrupted flag is now set, after the task completes, is there a process that resets the flag? Else that thread managed through <code>ExecutorService</code> will fail with <code>InterruptedException</code> when it tries to take up next request which contains a blocking call.</p>\n"

So yeah, my main question is, help me understand how something is build and works, because currently all i can is to print “hello world”... btw, im not a computer newbie, just the programming that don’t really get...\nBtw, is Swift a nice language to start with? I choose it, because it looks kind of fun and intuitive without writing too much cr*p. </p>\n"
